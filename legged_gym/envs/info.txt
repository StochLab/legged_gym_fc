    exp10:
        same as exp9, but on flat terrain

    hw1: with actual linvel + 100N default z-force + flat terrain
         + 0.30 walking height + 0.10 swing height + 2.5 step frequency
    hw2: with zero linvel + 100N default z-force + flat terrain

 2) go1_wrench2 (cloned from go1_wrench1)

    swing height: 0.12
    walking height: 0.33

    exp1: with linvel in the observation + 100 N default z-force + flat terrain

    exp11: with zero linvel + 100 N default z-force + flat terrain
           + zero phase + (with randomised initial dof angles)

    Things to keep in mind for hardware deployment (gazebo):
        1. Check phase values (add some noise while training)
        2. check dof pos values
        3. check foot contacts


 3) go1_wrench3 (go1_wrench1 + velocity estimator)
    Observations: 56 (actual foot contacts in the observation)
    Actions: 6 (f_x, f_y, f_z, tau_x, tau_y, tau_z)
    run with --rl_algo=velocity_2 flag, uses rsl_rl_velocity_2

    exp1: vel estimator and the actor-critic are trained together.
          estimated velocity is a part of the observation.
          history size = 30
          swing height: 0.12
          walking height: 0.35

    exp2: same as exp1 with some changes in the rewards

    observations: 56 (des foot contacts in the obs)
    actions: 12 (x, y and z forces for fl, fr, bl, br respectively)
    walking height: 0.33
    swing height: 0.12

    exp1: with lin vel + No default z-forces on any leg + no zeroing swing forces
    exp2: with lin vel + default z-forces + zeroing swing forces


 5) go1_wrench4 (for walking on slopes)
    Observations: 56 (actual foot contacts in the observation)
    actions: 18 (com wrench + perturbation on joint angles)
    swing height: 0.12
    walking height: 0.33

    exp1: with lin vel + zero delta (no perturbation)
    exp2: with lin vel + delta of 0.5 radians for each angle
    exp3: with lin vel + zero delta + slopes
          + actual foot contact is considered from stance-to-swing
            or swing-to-stance switch after 60% of phase completion.

 6) go1_wrench5 (Cloned from go1_wrench1)
    Observations: 56 (actual foot contacts in the observation)
    actions: 18 (com wrench + desired joint angles)
    swing height: 0.12
    walking height: 0.33
    reward to follow the libtraj joint angles


 7) go1_wrench6:

    exp1: 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.5 step freq
       zero linvel in the observation
    exp2: 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.5 step freq
       actual linvel in the observation

 8) go1_wrench7 (with velocity estimator)
      0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.5 step freq, 1.0 stance_pc_factor

      exp1: observation includes estimated lin vel
      exp2: observation includes actual lin vel
      exp3: observation actual lin vel with 2.0 frequency and 1.2 stance_pc_factor

      hardware deployment: foot contacts seems to be a problem(?) Robot has rarely seen
      when all the four legs are in contact and don't know what to do. Hence, decrease
      the step frequency and increase the stance duration, so that robot gets to see
      the states when all 4 legs are in contact.
      Make the final action dependent only on the observation, not on desired contacts
      or else, include des contacts states in the observation ---> go1_wrench8

  9) go1_wrench8 (with velocity estimator)
      exp3:
           * 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.5 step freq, 1.0 stance_pc_factor
           * with actual linvel in the observation, distribution of forces depends on the
             desired foot contacts from libtraj.
           * desired foot contacts is added in the observation (in the end).
      exp4:
           * 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.0 step freq, 1.2 stance_pc_factor
           * with actual linvel in the observation, distribution of forces depends on the
             desired foot contacts from libtraj.
           * desired foot contacts is added in the observation (in the end).

      hardware deployment:
      foot contacts on hardware still seems to be a problem(?)
      Remove actual foot contacts from observation and use only the last desired contact
      states. Actual foot contact can still be used to make the libtraj closed-loop.

  10) go1_wrench9 (with velocity estimator)
      exp1:
           * 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.0 step freq, 1.2 stance_pc_factor
           * with actual linvel in the observation, distribution of forces depends on the
             desired foot contacts from libtraj.
           * desired foot contacts is added in the observation (in the end).
      exp2:
           * 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.5 step freq, 1.0 stance_pc_factor
           * with actual linvel in the observation, distribution of forces depends on the
             desired foot contacts from libtraj.
           * desired foot contacts is added in the observation (in the end).
      exp3:
           * 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.0 step freq, 1.2 stance_pc_factor
           * with actual linvel in the observation, distribution of forces depends on the
             desired foot contacts from libtraj.
           * desired foot contacts is added in the observation (in the end).
           * Libtraj is fully open-loop. Actual foot contacts doesn't affect the gait cycle.
      exp4:
           * 0.35 walking height, 0.12 swing height, 2.0 step freq, 1.2 stance_pc_factor
           * with actual linvel in the observation, distribution of forces depends on the
             desired foot contacts from libtraj.
           * desired foot contacts is added in the observation (in the end).
           * Libtraj is partially closed-loop. Early stance will make the libtraj switch
             that leg to stance.
      exp5:
           * same as exp4, except that default z-force of 100N is not added to the
             policy wrench.
      exp6:
           * exp5, with pd-scale of 0.25 on stance leg.
