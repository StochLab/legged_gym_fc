1) Changing damping friction torque limit does not produce any improvement.
2) Foot joint is fixed and therefore was not loaded. Including it works.
3) Including foot fixed joint and removing fixed rotor joints works the best.

List of Experiments:

Exp8: Trained on stairs with high steps: Robot didn't learn to raise its legs.
Exp9: Increasing feet air time coeff: In forward motion for some bots knee is touching the ground.
Exp10: Penalty on calf contact removed, feet stumble penalty increased: front leg knees are bent more than rear leg knees, IRL bot is vibrating.
Exp11: Exp10 + action rate penalty increased: front leg knees are bent more than rear leg knees, IRL bot is vibrating.
Note: Action rate penalty =-0.1 : agent not learning at all 
Exp12: orientation penalty = -0.1 : Front knee is no longer bending
Exp13: Exp12 + front thigh = 0.5 + rear thigh = 0.8 :
