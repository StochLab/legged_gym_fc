stoch3_force_control: libtraj for swing leg control + RL for GRFs
		      State - (com_height, roll_pitch_yaw, com_lin_vel_b, com_ang_vel_b, foot_contacts)
		      commands - (desired v_x, v_y, w_z)
		      Action: GRFs at each foot (12-dimensional) or wrench on the body (6-dimensional)
		              to be distributed amongs the legs sub to friction-cone constraints.
