1. Robot is not falling, but not able to follow commands and there seems to be a lot of jitter in swing leg.
   setting: 
	   num outputs - 12 (GRFs) in range of [-1, 1]
	   action scale: 30, 30, 60 (F_x, F_y, F_z)
	   GRFs = outputs * action_scale
	   GRFs_z += mg/(num_legs_in_stance)
2. To run everything on cpu use the following flags: --pipeline=cpu --rl_devide=cpu --sim_device=cpu
   (This seems to make some elements in observation as NaNs. Find out why.)
3. Make the z-direction forces from the policy always negative, since foot has to apply the force on the ground
   and, it is opposite in direction to positive z-axis.
4. Kp and Kd joint values of 20.0 and 1.0 seems to be good enough in case of MPC, i.e. same should be
   good enough for RL case as well assuming that the forces are good.
5. Should the decimation be 1? Is that good enough for force control like in MPC?

Exp1:
    1. decimation = 4, num_actions = 12 (direct grfs)
    2. tau_ff = J^T. f
    3. Kp = 20.0, Kd = 1.0

Exp2:
    1. Decimation = 1
    2. num_actions = 6, distribute wrench
    3. tau_ff = -J^T. F
    4. Kp = 20.0, kd = 1.0
